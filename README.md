# pixel-occupancy-filter
This package provides a bayesian occupancy filter that takes in black & white images of a scene (representing events acquired from an event camera) and calculate the occupancy probability of each pixel of an image with predefined resolution. The output image is the scene representation as seen from the image plane of the camera.

This package targets mainly a single-axis rotating event camera platform though it can be used for static platform for other purposes as well.
